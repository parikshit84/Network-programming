The Red Barn sits alongside Scioto Road in a narrow valley in northeastern Tennessee a few miles from the borders of North Carolina and Virginia. Most of the time, the hollows, as such valleys are known in this part of Appalachia, are quiet, but on Thursday nights for the last 30 years they have come alive with music.

The Red Barn is the site of a longstanding tradition in these mountains: old-time music, string-band music, bluegrass music.

Practitioners take up guitars, mandolins, banjos and fiddles, and, in the words of one of the genre’s classic tunes, “make them sing.”

Other community traditions are embraced at the casual weekly gatherings. There is no charge for entry; all ages are welcome; fans refrain from dancing during hymns; and, just like a church supper, food is brought for sharing. “It’s family entertainment — no alcohol, no riffraff,” said Burl Mast, owner, founder and banjo picker.

Dozens of such venues are in this three-state area, which is known for barn dances, for porch picking, for “sittin’ in” wherever a community of musicians has gathered. Residents say it is the original capital of country music, a valid claim given the role played by the area’s three main cities, Kingsport, Johnson City and Bristol. The population of these and nearby smaller towns totals more than 500,000 people, making the area one of the largest metropolitan centers in Appalachia.

But the larger settlements don’t define the area as much as the mountains and hollows. An early-morning October drive on one of the twisting two-lane roads is through a multicolored autumnal landscape sprinkled with wisps of low-lying fog, mountains looming over the fields.

Traditionally those mountains meant isolation, relieved periodically by gatherings for church, for barn-raising or harvest help. And the gatherings meant string-band music.

Southern Appalachia had become known for its musical heritage by the late 1800s. Many of its Scots-Irish settlers brought their jigs and reels with them when they emigrated. In 1927, Ralph Peer of the Victor Talking Machine Company spent two weeks in Bristol recording area artists. Those pioneering sessions included songs by the Carter Family of Virginia (A.P., his wife, Sara, and his sister-in-law, Maybelle) and Jimmie Rodgers of North Carolina. The resulting records led to national attention, attracting more musicians to the Tri-Cities, as the area became known.

When radio and television were speeding the spread of country music across the nation in the 1950s, bluegrass and old-time tunes could be heard, it seemed, just about everywhere in the region. At church gatherings, gospel quartets moved outside and were joined by string bands. Front porches were turned into stages as music makers jammed. Livestock shared their quarters with revelers at barn dances. Fiddles, guitars and banjos even accompanied the routine of haircuts at the Star Barber Shop in downtown Bristol, where the main street defines the Tennessee-Virginia line.

Beginning in the early 1950s, Gene Boyd, the Star’s owner, and several friends held jam sessions, with Mr. Boyd fiddling when he wasn’t cutting hair. Musicians came and went depending on what other tasks they had to take care of that day. The tradition ended when Mr. Boyd retired in 2008 at age 80.

As more formal places sprang up, more musicians began to make a living doing what they loved. Tunes made famous by A.P. Carter and his family became part of America’s musical heritage as mainstream artists recorded them.

In 2005, East Tennessee State University in Johnson City began offering a minor in Appalachian Studies: Bluegrass, Old-Time and Country Music. In 2010, it became a major. The program draws from the surrounding mountains, and from around the world. Currently enrolled are students from Scandinavia, Japan, Iran and, taking the music back full circle to its roots, Scotland and England, according to Lee Bidgood, a faculty member.

Bristol’s Rhythm and Roots Reunion, which began in 2001, attracted more than 55,000 fans in mid-September for three days of picking, flat-step dancing and fellowship. The lineup included scores of acts including Emmylou Harris, Jeff Tweedy, Seldom Scene and Ray Wylie Hubbard. (Next year, the festival will be Sept. 18 to 20).

But a visitor can pack a week’s worth of music into a weekend just about any time of the year. Or make it two weekends, filling in the daytime with visits to the new Birthplace of Country Music Museum in Bristol, an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. The museum, which opened in August, features exhibitions ranging from the beginnings (the porch for open-air gathering, the church for gospel singing, the low-wattage radio station for broadcasting live performances) to a special section on Tennessee Ernie Ford, a Bristol native, to a 100-seat performance and teaching theater, to a venue featuring a floor designed for clogging.

Jessica Turner, the museum director, is an ethnomusicologist who holds a doctorate from Indiana University. The music played a major role in defining the community, she said on a recent tour of the museum. It is continuing the neighborly tradition, encouraging residents to bring in old family photos that are relevant. “We want them to be a part of the museum,” she said.
Interactive displays include a song-mixing area and a recording booth where visitors can sing along with classic numbers in a sort of ultimate karaoke experience.

After absorbing an introduction and listening to Ralph Peer’s Victor recordings at the museum, visitors can then check out the schedules at dozens of area sites. Many offer opportunities to perform, with regularly scheduled open-mic nights.

There are mountain-getaway opportunities, too. The Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, Roan Mountain State Park, and the northern section of the Cherokee National Forest are all nearby with dozens of camping destinations. The Appalachian Trail is only one of many hiking pathways. And there is Jonesborough, the state’s oldest incorporated town, with buildings dating from the late 1700s. Presidents Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk and Andrew Johnson once walked its streets.

The town is also home to the National Storytelling Festival, which began in 1973. Today, the association that sprang from that first gathering runs a downtown center celebrating tales from around the world. (Next year’s festival is scheduled for Oct. 2 to 4.)

My friend James Noel Smith is a native of the area who grew up listening to the music and the stories. Before weekend forays to area farmers’ markets, he told me, he and wife, Michelle, include as much discussion about who is playing as they do about who has the best collard greens. A recent discovery, he added, is Jiggy Ray’s, a pizza spot in nearby Elizabethton that features bluegrass on Saturday nights. Even though he is a native, he said he is continually amazed at how much great music is available, and in such unlikely places. “Pizza with bluegrass?” he said with a laugh.
